# Restaurant Page

:arrow_forward:  **[Live preview!](https://nekosoffy.github.io/restaurant-page/)**

This project consists of a website with multiple pages whose contents, for the most part, are added dynamically with DOM manipulation instead of HTML as usual. It features a fictional tea shop's commercial page, allowing the user to visit each section by clicking on the header's buttons.
